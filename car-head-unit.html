    <h2>Product Information</h2>

        form.

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        I got my Mazda MX5 a few years ago, and it came with a Sony (some numbers). It plays CDs and connects to my old
        iPod, but refuses to interface with my phone and the bluetooth sound quality is terrible. Looking on the market,
        fumctionality that brings
        an older car like mine up to modern standards cist upwards of $500, and don't even have a volume knob. When I
        saw this, I chose to take things into my own hands. The head unit we have designed here at Algebuckina Design
        uses off the shelf components
        (when they are in stock, sorry) to make a more open and far cheaper competitor to the competition, while still
        keeping the option for android auto compatability.
    </p>
    <p>
        We sell a kit to mount all the off the shelf components together, but the schematics can also be found on our
        Github so you can make it yourself. We also offer SD cards preloaded with Android Auto so no software skill is
        required.
