    <h2>Service Information</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Our website service offers the ability to host your own forum and webpages locally instead of paying for a
        hosting service. Our service is based on the NodeBB platform, which is a powerful, mobile ready and easy to use
        forum and website manager that we
        have years of experience working with at Algebuckina Design. We setup a Virtualbox VM for you to run on your own
        system, and for additional fees, maintain, support and develop your website. If you're interested in what NodeBB
        can offer your company
        or venture, see what it can do on <a href="https://nodebb.org/product/">their website.</a>
    </p>
    <p>We would like to stress that the website is yours once we send you the VM. No additional costs will incur unless
        you require us to make changes, provide support or add new features. NodeBB offers an ongoing fee for them to
        run your website for you,
        we want to put that control back in your hands.</p>
